## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or declined, etc.

To report a vulnerability, please send an email to security@laravel.com. You can expect to receive an initial response within 24 hours. If the vulnerability is accepted, we will release a security patch as soon as possible depending on the severity of the issue. If the vulnerability is declined, we will inform you of the reasons why. We appreciate your help in making Laravel more secure.
